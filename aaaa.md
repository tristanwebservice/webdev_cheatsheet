## Notes for AI Summarization
- Each chapter includes **Topics** (core concepts), **Skills** (learning outcomes), and **Projects/Exercises** (practical applications).
- Chapters are modular, allowing an AI to generate concise summaries per chapter by focusing on:
  - Key concepts explained in simple terms.
  - Beginner-friendly examples tied to projects.
  - Practical applications of skills learned.
- The syllabus assumes no prior knowledge, so summaries should avoid jargon and clarify technical terms (e.g., "DOM" as "the structure of a webpage").
- For the capstone (YelpCamp), the summary should emphasize how it integrates all prior chapters into a single project.
