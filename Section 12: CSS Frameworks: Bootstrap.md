# CSS Frameworks: Bootstrap

## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework that simplifies web development by providing pre-designed components, responsive grid systems, and utility classes. It enables developers to create responsive and mobile-first websites quickly and efficiently.

## Including Bootstrap and Containers

To use Bootstrap in a project, you can include it via a CDN or by downloading the files. The recommended way is to link to the Bootstrap CSS and JS files in the `<head>` section of your HTML document.

```html
<!-- Example of including Bootstrap via CDN -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script># CSS Frameworks: Bootstrap - Summary

```

Bootstrap uses a container class to create a responsive fixed-width or fluid-width lay-ut. Containers can be created using `.container` for fixed width or `.container-fluid` for full width.

```html
<!-- Example of a Bootstrap container -->
<div class="container">
  <h1>Welcome to Bootstrap</h1>
</div>
```

## Bootstrap Buttons

Bootstrap provides a variety of button styles using the `.btn` class along with contextual classes like `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, etc. Buttons can also be sized and styled as outlines.

```html

<button class="btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-outline-success">Outline Button</button>
```

<h1 class="display-1">Display Heading</h1>
<p class="text-muted">This is a muted text.</p>
```

## Badges, Alerts, Button Groups

    <span class="badge badge-primary">New</span>
    ```

      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 1</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 2</button>
    </div>

## Intro to the Bootstrap Grid

Bootstrap's grid system is based on a 12-column layout that allows for responsive design. It uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.

```html
<!-- Example of Bootstrap grid -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">Column 1</div>
    <div class="col">Column 2</div>
    <div class="col">Column 3</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Responsive Bootstrap Grids

Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes. You can specify how many columns an element should span at various breakpoints using classes like `.col-sm-`, `.col-md-`, `.col-lg-`, etc.

<!-- Example of responsive grid -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">Column 1</div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">Column 2</div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">Column 3</div>
  </div>
</div>
```
